# ViewLeft Challenge

Hello ViewLift,

Thank you so much for taking the time to look through my assignment. 

I hope it shows off a little of what I am capable of doing on the front end, particularly my skills with Angular and front end frame works.

Your company sounds exciting and interesting, and as a front end developer this sounds like a really exciting oppurtunity for me!
